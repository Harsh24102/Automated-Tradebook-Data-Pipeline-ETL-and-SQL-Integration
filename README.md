# Automated-Tradebook-Data-Pipeline-ETL-and-SQL-Integration
Overview

This project builds an automated data pipeline to manage large-scale tradebook data. It extracts, cleans, transforms, and stores raw files using Python (Pandas) into a SQL Server database for fast, accurate access. The pipeline integrates Power BI dashboards to visualize trader performance, strategies, and anomalies, enabling data-driven decision-making.

# Key Features

Automated ETL pipeline using Python (Pandas) for data cleaning and merging.

SQL Server integration for efficient storage and querying of 1M+ trade records.

Power BI dashboards to visualize trader performance, strategies, and anomalies.

Batch automation for streamlined execution and reduced manual effort.
